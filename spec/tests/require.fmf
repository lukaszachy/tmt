summary: Packages, libraries, files or directories required for test execution

story:
    As a tester I want to specify packages, libraries, files and directories
    which are required by the test and need to be installed on/copied over to
    the system so that the test can be successfully executed.

description: |
    In order to execute the test, additional packages may need to
    be installed on the system. For example `gcc` and `make` are
    needed to compile tests written in C on the target machine. If
    the package cannot be installed test execution must result
    in an ``error``.

    For tests shared across multiple components or product
    versions where required packages have different names it is
    recommended to use the :ref:`/spec/plans/prepare` step
    configuration to specify required packages for each component
    or product version individually.

    When referencing beakerlib libraries it is possible to use
    both the backward-compatible syntax ``library(repo/lib)``
    which fetches libraries from the `default location`__ as well
    as provide a ``dictionary`` with a full `fmf identifier`__.

    When referencing local files or directories you can define list of paths
    relative to fmf root directory, these can be regular expressions
    to match multiple files/directories or just a single file or directory.
    By default everything under ``Test.path`` is copied over to the system.

    For the libraries defined by fmf identifier and local files or directories
    it is important to use ``type`` key, otherwise library type will be used.
    Values are ``library`` and ``file`` respectively.

    By default, fetched repositories are stored in the discover
    step workdir under the ``libs`` directory. Use optional key
    ``destination`` to choose a different location. The ``nick``
    key can be used to override the default git repository name.

    For debugging beakerlib libraries it is useful to reference
    the development version directly from the local filesystem.
    Use the ``path`` key to specify a full path to the library.

    Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` using package
    specification supported by ``dnf`` which takes care of the
    installation or a ``dictionary`` if using fmf identifier to
    fetch dependent repositories.

example:
  - |
    # Require a single package
    require: make

  - |
    # Multiple packages
    require: [gcc, make]

  - |
    # Multiple packages on separate lines
    require:
      - gcc
      - make

  - |
    # Library from the default upstream location
    require: library(openssl/certgen)

  - |
    # Library from a custom remote git repository
    require:
      - url: https://github.com/beakerlib/openssl
        name: /certgen

  - |
    # Library from the local filesystem
    require:
      - path: /tmp/library/openssl
        name: /certgen

  - |
    # Use a custom git ref and nick for the library
    require:
      - url: https://github.com/redhat-qe-security/certgen
        ref: devel
        nick: openssl
        name: /certgen
        type: library

  - |
    # Require local files needed for the library or test
    require:
      - type: file
        pattern:
          - /include
          - /Library/common/helper.sh
          - /files/photos/IMG.*

  - |
    # Require whole fmf tree
    require:
      - type: file
        pattern:
          - /
